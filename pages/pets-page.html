  <h1>Sadie and Nugget</h1>

  <h2>Even though Sadie and Nugget are pets, they are still considered extra children to Jared and Kellee. Here is a
    little bit
    about both of them! </h2>

  <img src="../assets/images/sadie.jpg" alt="Sadie">

  <p class="sadie">Sadie is a English Cream Golden Retriever that was born in May of 2024. She's still young and full of
    energy, and her favorite chew toy recently has been Will's socks. She is convinced she's a lap dog, weighing in at
    60 pounds, and will try to climb onto your lap if you give her a chance. She is a very sweet puppy and keeps Jared
    and Kellee busy with her
    constant sprinting around and obsession with the squirrels in the backyard. She tries her best to be friends with
    the grouchy cat Nugget and pretty much anyone that walks through the door. She keeps life for the Balcoms very
    entertaining and is always around when someone needs some extra love.</p>

  <img src="../assets/images/nugget.jpg" alt="Nugget">

  <p class="nugget"> Nugget is a long-haired Calico cat that was adopted by the Balcom family in 2014. She was a barn
    cat
    of a family friend and the Balcom family wanted a cat to help keep the mice away. Little did they know that Nugget
    would not be very good at catching mice, but very good at killing snakes. She has a lot of personality for a little
    cat, often sending killer glares to the newest addition to the family, Sadie. Nugget is a large cat and has no
    problem making sure Sadie knows who's in charge. Although Nugget spends a lot of her time outside, when she does
    come inside, she loves to spend time on Will or McKaila's bed. Her patience is low for people most times, but she
    can be very loving from time to time. She's getting older, and in her old age she's becoming more accepting of love
    from strangers. Nugget is pretty vocal, often voicing her concerns with her near empty food dish. Nugget keeps the
    Balcoms on thier toes, changing her attitude in a matter of seconds. Nugget is a very important part of the Balcom
    family. </p>
